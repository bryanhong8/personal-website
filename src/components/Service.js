              I am on the organizing committee for <a href="https://www.sciencerendezvousuoft.ca/" className="font-extrabold text-custom-green hover:underline">Science Rendezvous</a>, an
              annual all-day family-friendly street festival for the Toronto community that promotes
              science awareness and interest.

              Iâ€™ve also served many executive roles
              on the <a href="https://uoft-pgsa.org/" className="font-extrabold text-custom-green hover:underline">Psychology Graduate Student Association</a>, helping to
              improve the graduate student experience in the Psychology department.
              During my time as President of the PGSA, I helped to organize the first
              Non-Academic Career Panel, where former Psychology graduate students
              shared their experiences transitioning to careers outside academia.
