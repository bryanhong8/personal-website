              I love having the opportunity to share my knowledge with others and
              equipping students with new skills. I have developed materials for and
              taught <a href="https://fas.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/psy201h1" className="font-extrabold text-custom-blue hover:underline">PSY201 (Statistics I)</a>, an
              introductory statistics course at the University of Toronto. I have over four years
              of experience as a teaching assistant across eight different undergraduate
              courses, ranging from introductory psychology courses aimed at first-year
              students to research seminar courses aimed at upper-year specialist students.

              I also am a certified instructor for <a href="https://carpentries.org/" className="font-extrabold text-custom-blue hover:underline">The Carpentries</a>, an
